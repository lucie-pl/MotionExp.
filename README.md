Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.

<strong>MotionExp.</strong> is a prototype of a mobile web app, it was designed and developed by Lucie Plantier, Lorry Brossard and Hongri Ma in 2 weeks. 
It was our final project during the Web Development bootcamp provided by Le Wagon. This 9-week intensive bootcamp spanned from October to December 2023.

The reason to be of this project : <strong>Allow moviegoers to search for movie information, keep track of all the movies they saw or want to see, and also allow them to get notifications on specific films if ever a screening is programmed in a cinema near them.</strong>

Good job team ! :)
